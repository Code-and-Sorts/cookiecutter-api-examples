# KittenClaws API

[![Made with Cookiecutter API](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-and-Sorts/cookiecutter-api/main/.docs/badge.json)](https://github.com/Code-and-Sorts/cookiecutter-api)

## Overview

This project is a Dotnet-based REST API built using [Azure Function Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/). The API leverages Azure's serverless architecture, allowing you to deploy and scale functions effortlessly in the cloud. The HTTP-triggered functions serve as the endpoints for the API, providing a seamless way to handle client requests.

The REST API exposes the following resources and operations:

- **`/api/cats`** (container: `animals`)
  - `GET /api/cats` — list
  - `GET /api/cats/{id}` — get by ID
  - `POST /api/cats` — create
  - `PATCH /api/cats/{id}` — partial update
  - `DELETE /api/cats/{id}` — soft delete
- **`/api/dogs`** (container: `animals`)
  - `GET /api/dogs` — list
  - `GET /api/dogs/{id}` — get by ID
  - `POST /api/dogs` — create
  - `PUT /api/dogs/{id}` — full replace
  - `DELETE /api/dogs/{id}` — soft delete
- **`/api/health`**
  - `GET /api/health` — health check

Paths are relative to the Function App host (`http://localhost:7071` when running locally); `/api` is the Azure Functions default route prefix.

Dependency management is handled using [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/), ensuring a streamlined and consistent environment for managing Dotnet packages and their dependencies.

## API behaviour

Every response body is JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`), including errors.

| Case | Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| create | 201 | the item |
| get, update, replace | 200 | the item |
| list | 200 | JSON array of items (`[]` when empty) |
| delete | 200 | `{"message": "<Name> with id <id> was deleted successfully."}` |
| health | 200 | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| invalid request body | 400 | `{"errorMessage": "<what is wrong>"}` |
| id not found, soft-deleted or not a UUID | 404 | `{"errorMessage": "<Name> with id <id> was not found."}` |
| anything unexpected | 500 | `{"errorMessage": "An unexpected error occurred."}` (the exception is logged with its stack trace) |

An item has exactly these fields, the stored values (`createdBy` and `updatedBy` only when they are set; never `null`):

```json
{
  "id": "0f3a7ff7-a601-4d23-b33c-7f8f18b57a4c",
  "name": "Cat1",
  "createdTimestamp": "2026-09-29T22:49:26.625Z",
  "createdBy": "user-1",
  "updatedTimestamp": "2026-09-30T08:12:03.041Z",
  "updatedBy": "user-2"
}
```

`isDeleted` and database fields are never returned. A create returns `createdTimestamp` equal to `updatedTimestamp`; update and replace return the new `updatedTimestamp` and `updatedBy` (absent when the request has no `X-User-Id`) with the created fields unchanged.

Request bodies must be a JSON object: `name` is required on create (`POST`) and replace (`PUT`) and optional on update (`PATCH`), and when present it must be a non-empty JSON string (numbers and booleans are not converted). Any other field, including `id`, `isDeleted`, the timestamps, `createdBy` and `updatedBy`, is rejected with `400`, so clients can never set ids or system fields.

Writes (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE`) record who made them from the optional `X-User-Id` request header (surrounding whitespace is trimmed; an empty or missing header means no user). Create stores it as `createdBy` and `updatedBy`, and later writes store it as `updatedBy`, removing any earlier `updatedBy` when the header is absent. A value longer than 256 characters is rejected with `400 {"errorMessage": "X-User-Id must be at most 256 characters."}` before the body is read. The header is taken as sent and is not authenticated: any caller can set it. Before relying on `createdBy`/`updatedBy`, put the API behind an authenticating gateway or authorizer that sets `X-User-Id` from the verified identity and strips any value the client sent.

Each request's database work is bounded by a 5-second deadline (`Utils/RequestDeadline.cs`) and the database client has capped timeouts and retries, so an unreachable or failing database answers the generic `500` well inside the platform timeout. A request that hits the deadline returns `500`, but the write may still complete, so retrying a create can store a duplicate. A request the client cancels is logged at information level, not as an error.

List endpoints accept `?limit=<n>` (default `100`, at most `1000`); a missing or invalid value uses the default and a larger value is capped.

Requests that never reach the app are answered by the Azure Functions host: an unknown path, or a method a function is not registered for, returns `404` with an empty body.

Stored records hold `id`, `name`, `isDeleted`, `createdTimestamp` and `updatedTimestamp` (ISO-8601 UTC with millisecond precision, for example `2026-09-29T22:49:26.625Z`), plus `createdBy`/`updatedBy` only when they are set. Updates and replacements keep `createdTimestamp` and `createdBy` and refresh `updatedTimestamp` and `updatedBy`; delete is a soft delete that sets `isDeleted` to `true`.

## Storage containers

Each resource reads and writes the Cosmos DB container configured for its `container` id. The container names are read from these settings (see `local.settings.json`), falling back to the container id when a setting is missing:

| Container | Setting | Default value | Resources |
|---|---|---|---|
| `animals` | `CosmosDbContainerName_Animals` | `animals` | Cat, Dog |

The Cosmos DB connection string is read from `ConnectionStrings:CosmosDb` (`ConnectionStrings__CosmosDb` in `local.settings.json` `Values`, so a value already in the environment, such as the emulator's, takes precedence) and the database name from `CosmosDbDatabaseName`. Containers must use `/id` as their partition key. The connection string's `AccountKey` is optional: with `AccountEndpoint` alone (`AccountEndpoint=https://<account>.documents.azure.com:443/;`) the client authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID (`DefaultAzureCredential`, which picks the managed identity named by `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`).

`CosmosDbConnectionMode` selects the Cosmos DB connection mode: `Direct` (the default when the setting is missing, and the best choice in Azure) or `Gateway`. `local.settings.json` sets it to `Gateway` because the [Linux Cosmos DB emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-linux) only supports Gateway mode. `CosmosDbEmulator=true` is for local development only (see [Run locally against the emulator](#run-locally-against-the-emulator)).

Resources that use the same container share its records: there is no type discriminator, so every resource on a shared container lists, reads, updates and deletes the same items.

## Features

- Azure Function Apps: Utilizes Azure's serverless platform to create scalable and efficient endpoints with HTTP triggers.

- Dotnet-Based: Written entirely in Dotnet, leveraging its rich ecosystem and libraries for rapid development.

- Nuget for Dependency Management: Manages all Dotnet dependencies with Nuget, making the development environment consistent and easy to set up.

- Cosmos DB NoSQL Account: This project uses Cosmos DB NoSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- Dotnet 10.x

- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools): To run the Function Apps locally.

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/): To deploy and manage Azure Function Apps.

- [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download): Dotnet SDK and CLI

- Azure Account: An active Azure subscription for deploying the Function App. On Linux, .NET 10 apps must run on the [Flex Consumption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan) plan (or Premium/Dedicated); the Linux Consumption plan does not support .NET 10.

- Cosmos DB NoSQL Account either deployed in Azure or emulated locally (see [Run locally against the emulator](#run-locally-against-the-emulator)).

## Setup and Installation

1. Install Azure Functions Core Tools

    Follow the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-python#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) to install Azure Function Core Tools based on your operating system.

2. Install Dotnet SDK

    If you haven't already installed Dotnet SDK, you can do so by following the [official installation guide](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

3. Install Dependencies

    Install all dependencies:

    ```console
    make install
    ```

    To be able to run the project locally, set the environment variable values in the local.settings.json project file.

4. Run the API Locally

    ```console
    make run
    ```

    This command starts the local development server using the Azure Function Core Tools, where you can interact with your API endpoints.

5. Thunderclient

    Included in the project is a [Thunderclient](https://www.thunderclient.com/) collection in the .thunderclient directory to easily test the locally hosted APIs.

## Run locally against the emulator

`docker-compose.yml` runs the [Azure Cosmos DB emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-linux) in Docker, so the API can serve requests without a cloud account. You need Docker with Compose v2 and Azure Functions Core Tools; for Podman, add `COMPOSE="podman compose"` to each `make` command.

```console
make install
make emulator-up      # docker compose up -d --wait: returns once the emulator is healthy
make emulator-seed    # creates the database and one container per storage container; safe to re-run
make run-emulator     # func start in KittenClaws.Api with the emulator settings
make emulator-down    # docker compose down -v: stops the emulator and discards its data
```

`make emulator-logs` follows the emulator's logs. `make emulator-seed` runs `KittenClaws.Bootstrap`, a console project in the solution that reuses the API's client setup and store name settings. It and `make run-emulator` export the settings in `.env.emulator`, which take precedence over `local.settings.json`: Core Tools skips any setting already in the environment, and `Program.cs` reads environment variables after `local.settings.json`. `.env.emulator` is committed and holds only public emulator values; keep real credentials in untracked files such as `local.settings.json` or `.env.local`, which git ignores. The emulator keeps no data outside its container, so `make emulator-down` (or removing the container) discards every record.

| Port | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 8081 | Cosmos DB gateway (`http://localhost:8081/`) |
| 1234 | Data Explorer: open `http://localhost:1234` to browse databases and items |

- The image is the Linux [vNext emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator-linux) (preview). It serves plain HTTP, so there is no certificate to trust, and it runs natively on x64 and arm64, including Apple Silicon. Partition key `/id`, conditional patch (soft delete), `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` and parameterized queries all work against it.
- The `AccountKey` in `ConnectionStrings__CosmosDb` is the emulator's well-known account key, published by Microsoft; it is not a secret and only works against the emulator.
- `CosmosDbEmulator=true` switches the client to Gateway mode and `LimitToEndpoint`, so it keeps using the connection string's endpoint instead of the address the emulator advertises, and, for an `https://` endpoint only, skips certificate verification. Never set it outside local development; when it is unset or false the client is configured exactly as in production.
- To use the older HTTPS-only emulator (`mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest`) instead, swap the image in `docker-compose.yml` (its readiness probe is `https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem`) and set the connection string's `AccountEndpoint` to `https://localhost:8081/`. That image runs on x64 only (not on Apple Silicon) and takes 1 to 3 minutes to start.

Startup takes about 10 to 60 seconds; the healthcheck allows up to 4 minutes for slow machines and CI runners. `make emulator-seed` retries for up to 2 minutes and exits non-zero if the emulator never becomes ready, so it also works as a readiness gate in scripts.

Troubleshooting:

- **Port already in use:** another emulator or service holds a port above. Stop it, or change the host port in `docker-compose.yml` and in `.env.emulator`.
- **`make emulator-up` fails or never turns healthy:** check `make emulator-logs`, and that Docker has enough free memory for the emulator.
- **Requests fail right after starting:** run `make emulator-seed`; the database and containers do not exist until it has run, and `make emulator-down` deletes them.
- **A missing container returns 404 instead of 500:** the emulator reports a missing container without the sub-status a Cosmos DB account sends; run `make emulator-seed`.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Dependency

```bash
dotnet add package <package-name>
```

### Removing a Dependency

```bash
dotnet remove package <package-name>
```

### Adding a field

Fields are written out in each layer, so a new field touches these files under `KittenClaws.Api` (shown for `Cat`; to add an optional `Age`):

1. `Models/Entities/CatEntity.cs`: add `public int? Age { get; set; }`.
2. `Models/Dtos/CatDto.cs`: add the property clients get back; it serializes after `name` and before the timestamps, which `BaseDto` holds.
3. `Models/CatRequests.cs`: add `[JsonPropertyName("age")] public int? Age { get; set; }` to each request; `RequestBody` rejects any field without `[JsonPropertyName]`.
4. `Models/Schemas/CatValidation.cs`: add the rules, for example `RuleFor(x => x.Age).GreaterThanOrEqualTo(0).When(x => x.Age != null);`.
5. `Services/CatService.cs` and `Repositories/CatRepository.cs`: copy the field from the request into the entity, set it in `MapFields` (`EntityRepository` maps `id` and the audit fields), and in the update merge keep the stored value when the request leaves it out (`changes.Age ?? current.Age`).
6. Add the field to the tests in `KittenClaws.Api.Tests.Unit` and to the Thunder Client requests in `.thunderclient/`.

## Running Tests

Ensure your code is working as expected by running unit tests using dotnet test:

```bash
make test-unit
```

## Vulnerability Scanning

Scan project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities:

```bash
make audit
```

This uses `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive` to check for packages with known CVEs. It is also run automatically in CI on every PR and push to main.

Each resource has its own file in every layer, named after the resource: for example `CatController.cs`, `CatService.cs`, `CatRepository.cs`, `CatFunctions.cs` and their `ICat…` interfaces, DTO, entity, request and validation models, and unit tests.
Each repository extends `EntityRepository`, which holds the shared read, list, create, update and soft-delete logic and talks to the database through `IDocumentStore` (`CosmosDocumentStore`).
